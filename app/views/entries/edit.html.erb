<h1>Edit Entry</h1>

<%= render 'form', entry: @entry %>

<%= link_to "Back", entries_url %>
<!-- This page should have a form to allow a user to modify the details of an existing definition.

Hints:

This is another dynamic route, so youâ€™ll need to use the params hash to retrieve the right entry from the database
You should use form_for
Your form code should start to look an awful lot like the code from the new page - refactor to use a partial view that both pages can render in order to keep your code DRY -->
